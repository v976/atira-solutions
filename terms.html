        <p><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">1.Welcome to Atira Solutions Private Limited. These terms and conditions govern
                        your
                        use of our creative solutions. By engaging our services, you agree to abide by these
                        terms.</span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">2. &nbsp;We offer various creative solutions, but not limited to design,
                        development,
                        maintenance, marketing and support. Details of specific services and deliverables will be
                        outlined in the
                        project proposal or contract.</span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">3. &nbsp;The scope of each project will be outlined in a detailed proposal or
                        contract,
                        which will include deliverables, timelines, and specific requirements. Any modifications to the
                        initial
                        scope,
                        including additional features or changes requested after the project has commenced, will be
                        subject to a
                        formal
                        change request process. This process may involve revised timelines and additional fees. The
                        scope and any
                        amendments must be agreed upon in writing by both parties to be effective.</span></p>

                        deposit
                        may
                        be required before work begins, with the balance due upon completion or as specified in the
                        contract. Late
                        payments are discouraged.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">5. &nbsp;You agree to provide all necessary content, feedback, and approvals in
                        a
                        timely manner. Delays in providing this information may impact project timelines.</span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">6. &nbsp;Either party may terminate the contract with written notice. If
                        terminated,
                        you will be responsible for payment for work completed up to the date of termination.</span></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">7. &nbsp;Our liability for any claim arising out of or related to our services
                        will
